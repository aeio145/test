% The main.m script executes everything. First it runs initiate.m
That script checks if the necessary files exist, stops the code if they
are not in the folder.

Next it checks for a Results folder and creates one if it's not there
This ends initiate.m

Next main.m runs the script import.csv

This script reads 3 files and stores them in the matlab workspace.

First is the parameters.txt. This file is for parameters to run the matlab
scripts (0 or 1) To quickly change the behaviour of the code. I have it set
with an example of a boolean called "save". If set to one, the plot will be
saved to the results folder. If set to 0 it won't.

The number of variables can be changed, right now it's only an example.

values.csv contains Initial values or variables such as conductivity, Thot,
... New Variables can be added but this should be done in the 
simulation code in c

data.csv contains all the results from the simulation. First line is the 
variable next are the values

Finally I  made an example plot


%%EXAMPLE1 data.csv

Heatflux,Position,Temp
25,165,55
30,175,70
22,180,68


%%EXAMPLE2 data.csv new variable

Heatflux,Position,Temp,val
25,165,55,0
30,175,70,1
22,180,68,0


%%EXAMPLE3 
%parameters.csv
bool1,bool2,save
0,0,1
%values.csv
Thot,Tcold,k,ro,alpha
50,20,3.2,19.3,0.02
%data.csv
Heatflux,Position,Temp
25,165,55
30,175,70
22,180,68
